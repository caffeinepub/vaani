# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish the global header spacing and refine the Home (landing) page to a clean, minimal, premium Apple-style look while keeping existing structure and functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust global header layout to be slightly more compact and balanced across breakpoints, keeping the VAANI logo left-aligned and the Log in/user controls anchored top-right with consistent padding and alignment.
- Refine Home page styling (whitespace, typography, alignment, max-width, vertical rhythm) to feel premium and minimal without adding or removing any sections/content.
- Polish the Creator Zone card’s visual density (spacing and typography) to match the updated landing page styling, without changing form behavior or submission flow.
- Deploy an updated frontend build and update the deployment verification checklist to confirm header spacing/alignment and Home page typography/spacing changes in the live build.

**User-visible outcome:** The site header and landing page feel cleaner and more premium, with improved spacing and typography; the Creator Zone card looks more polished, and the updated UI is available in a newly deployed build for review.
