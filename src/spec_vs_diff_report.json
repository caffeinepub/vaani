  "summary": "The diff adds a redeploy script and updates verification documentation, but it does not provide evidence that an actual redeploy occurred or that the live deployment was verified. The diff also includes backend changes and numerous apparent frontend feature additions/changes that exceed the stated UI-only redeploy scope, and it lacks the required SVG asset file addition in the change list.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Redeploy the existing VAANI project (do not initialize a new project) to produce a publicly accessible testing build, retrying deployment if the previous attempt errored.",
      "reason": "The diff only adds a shell script that could be used to deploy, but contains no evidence that a deployment was actually performed, completed, and is publicly reachable. It also does not prove it targets an existing deployment/canister (e.g., no canister IDs, no deploy output, no URL).",
