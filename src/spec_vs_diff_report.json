  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3 appear implemented via Header, Home page, and Creator Zone card styling refinements, plus global design-system/tailwind polish. REQ-4 is partially satisfied by updating deployment verification documentation and adding a redeploy script, but an actual deployed build cannot be confirmed from the diff summary alone. The diff summary also indicates several authentication/routing/admin-related changes that were not requested and conflict with the stated non-goals/constraints.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "A new deployed build is produced after UI changes.",
      "reason": "The diff includes documentation and a redeploy script, but does not provide evidence that a new build was actually deployed (only that deployment tooling/checklists were updated).",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to UI spacing/alignment/hierarchy polish and lists non-goals around changing auth/product flows; these routing/redirect behaviors are new functional changes not requested.",

      "description": "Backend actor/auth logic change: automatic admin role assignment for a specific Principal ID and query invalidation behavior tied to actor changes.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest says no backend changes are required and to avoid altering Motoko state/schema; while this is frontend code, it changes authorization behavior and is not part of the requested UI polish.",
