  "summary": "The diff clearly refactors AuthContext to include an internal provider consuming Internet Identity state and adds deployment verification documentation, but it also modifies backend code (not requested) and does not provide direct diff evidence that the app root (main.tsx) now wraps the entire router tree in AuthProvider.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update the application root composition (in frontend/src/main.tsx or the root entry component it renders) so that RouterProvider, Header, CreatorZoneTab, and all routes are rendered inside the AuthProvider boundary.",
      "reason": "The modified-files list in the diff summary does not include frontend/src/main.tsx (or any other root entry component) changes, so there is no concrete diff evidence that the RouterProvider/router tree is actually wrapped by AuthProvider at the application root.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Modified files list does not include frontend/src/main.tsx"
      ]

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Do not modify compiled/built artifacts; apply the fix only in source TypeScript/TSX files (e.g., under frontend/src/**).",
      "reason": "A backend source file was modified, which violates the requirement to apply the fix only in frontend source TypeScript/TSX files.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Redeploy after applying the fix and verify using the checks described in frontend/DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md.",
      "reason": "The diff includes updates to the verification checklist, but there is no diff evidence of an actual redeploy or recorded verification results being completed.",

      "description": "Backend authorization/profile/audio submission logic changes.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is focused on fixing the frontend provider hierarchy and explicitly constrains scope (no backend changes unrelated to auth-provider wrapping). The diff shows substantive changes in backend/main.mo that are not requested by any REQ.",
